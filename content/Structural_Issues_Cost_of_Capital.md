# 🧠 Structural Analysis: Cost of Capital & Uncertainty

## 1. Why is India's Cost of Capital High? (Box III.9)
Despite reforms, India's interest rates remain structurally higher than peers.
* **Common Explanation:** Shallow bond markets, inflation.
* **Survey's Diagnosis:** The **Current Account Deficit (CAD)**.
    * *Logic:* Investment > Domestic Savings = Need for Foreign Capital (CAD).
    * *Result:* Reliance on foreign capital introduces a **Risk Premium**.
* **Empirical Evidence:** A 1% improvement in CAB reduces long-term interest rates by **2.8 basis points** (more effective than financial deepening).
* **Solution:** Improve **Manufacturing Productivity** $\rightarrow$ Higher Exports $\rightarrow$ Trade Surplus $\rightarrow$ Lower Cost of Capital.

## 2. Investment under Uncertainty (Box III.1)
How do firms behave during geopolitical shocks (e.g., US Tariffs)?
* **Real Options Channel:** Firms adopt a **"Wait-and-See"** approach.
* **Study Findings:**
    * **Mid-sized firms** cut capex the most (-4.7%).
    * **Small firms** are agile (-1%).
    * **Large firms** have buffers (-0.5%).
* **Policy Implication:** Deregulation is needed specifically to buffer **sector-specific uncertainty** (e.g., High-tech manufacturing).

## 3. Insurance: The "High Cost - Low Penetration" Trap
* **Paradox:** Insurance **Density** (Premium per person) is rising ($97), but **Penetration** (Premium as % of GDP) is falling/stagnant (**3.7%**).
* **Reason:** High **Distribution Costs** (Commissions) make premiums expensive.
* **Reform:** **Sabka Bima Sabki Suraksha Act, 2025** (100% FDI allowed, one-time registration for intermediaries).

**Mains Question Bank:**
1.  *“Reducing the cost of capital in India is less about financial reforms and more about structural improvements in the external sector.” Discuss.* (Ref: Box III.9)
2.  *Analyze the "Impact Washing" in microfinance. How can regulation balance commercial viability with social welfare?* (Ref: Box III.3)
