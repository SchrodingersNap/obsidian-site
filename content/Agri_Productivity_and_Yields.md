# The Productivity Paradox

Despite India being a global leader in total output, **yield per hectare** remains significantly below global benchmarks.

## 📉 The Yield Gap
Data comparison highlights the efficiency struggle:
* **Rice & Wheat:** Yields in major producing states (UP, West Bengal) trail the national and global averages.
* **Pulses:** High volatility due to rainfed dependence.
    * *El Niño Impact:* In 15 of 27 El Niño years, pulse yields dropped by 5-25%.
* **The Exception (Groundnut):** High yields in Gujarat/Tamil Nadu due to policy focus and export demand.

### Causes of Low Productivity
1.  **Fragmentation:** Small landholdings prevent economies of scale.
2.  **Resource Asymmetry:**
    * Irrigation coverage: Rice (~67%) vs. Millets (<15%).
3.  **Climate Stress:** Unseasonal rains and heat waves (wheat terminal heat).

## 🚀 Strategies for Improvement
The *Economic Survey 2025-26* suggests a shift from "Volume" to "Value" via:

### 1. Seed Technology
* **Seed Replacement Rate (SRR):** Needs improvement in pulses.
* **New Initiative:** National Mission on High-Yielding Seeds (Budget 2025-26).

### 2. Water Use Efficiency
* **Paradigm:** *Per Drop More Crop*.
* **Stats:** Gross irrigated area increased to **55.8%** (2022-23).
* **Focus:** Micro-irrigation and rejuvenating water bodies.

### 3. Aspirational Districts (PM-DDKY)
**Prime Minister Dhan Dhaanya Krishi Yojana:**
* **Target:** 100 Aspirational Agricultural Districts.
* **Criteria:** Low productivity, low cropping intensity, low credit flow.
* **Goal:** Converge 36 existing schemes to lift these districts above state averages.

> [!NOTE] Analyst Take
> The correlation between **irrigation access** and **poverty reduction** is stronger than the correlation between fertilizer subsidy and yield. Future investments must pivot to water management.
