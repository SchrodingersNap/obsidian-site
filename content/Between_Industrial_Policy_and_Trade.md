> [!ABSTRACT] Executive Summary
> The global economic consensus has fractured. The era of unfettered [[Free Trade]] is retreating, replaced by a new age of aggressive **Industrial Policy** led by the US and China.
> 
> This article argues that while India attempts to mimic these powers via schemes like [[PLI Scheme|PLI]], it faces a unique "sandwich" problem: squeezed between the **subsidy wars** of the West/China and its own **protectionist tariffs** that make domestic manufacturing uncompetitive. The core thesis is that you cannot have a successful Industrial Policy if your Trade Policy actively hurts your exporters.

## 1. The Death of the "Neoliberal Consensus"

For decades, the world operated on **Ricardian Comparative Advantage**:
* *US/Europe* did the R&D and Consumption.
* *China/Asia* did the Manufacturing.
* *Resources* flowed freely.

**The Shift:**
Post-COVID and post-Ukraine, efficiency has been replaced by **Security** and **Resilience**.
* **The US Move:** [[The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)]] and [[CHIPS Act]] are essentially massive state subsidies to re-shore manufacturing.
* **The China Move:** Decades of state-directed capitalism have created "Overcapacity" in EVs, Solar, and Batteries, which they are now dumping globally.

> [!NOTE] The Distortion Effect
> When superpowers engage in a "Subsidy War," global prices are distorted. An Indian factory isn't competing against a Chinese factory; it's competing against the *Chinese Treasury*.

## 2. India's Policy Response: The "Atmanirbhar" Pivot

India has responded with its own flavor of Industrial Policy:
1.  **Subsidies:** The [[Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme]] acts as a carrot to attract manufacturing (e.g., Apple, Foxconn).
2.  **Protectionism:** Raising import tariffs (Customs Duty) to shield these infant industries.

### The Hidden Cost of Protectionism
The article highlights a critical flaw in this strategy: **Inverted Duty Structures**.
* To protect domestic steel makers, we tax imported steel.
* *However*, the Indian car manufacturer (who needs steel) now pays *more* for their raw material than their competitor in Vietnam.
* **Result:** The car made in India becomes expensive and uncompetitive in the global market.

**The Paradox:**
$$\text{PLI Incentive} - \text{Tariff Cost} = \text{Net Negative Competitiveness}$$

> We are effectively subsidizing production with one hand (PLI) while penalizing it with the other (High Tariffs on inputs).

## 3. The "Deficit Nation" Trap

The article introduces the concept that **Industrial Policy works best for Surplus Nations** (like China/Germany) that have excess savings to fund subsidies.
* **Deficit Nations** (like the US and India) rely on foreign capital to fund their growth.
* When a deficit nation tries to "force" manufacturing through tariffs, it often leads to:
    1.  **Inflation:** Consumers pay more for goods.
    2.  **Currency Volatility:** Reduced export competitiveness widens the [[Current Account Deficit (CAD)]].
    3.  **Retaliation:** Trading partners impose counter-tariffs (e.g., [[EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)]]).

## 4. 🇮🇳 UPSC Perspective: Critical Analysis

This topic is "Gold Dust" for **GS Paper 3** (Economy) and **Essay**.

### 📝 Mains Answer Writing Inputs
* **Argument for Industrial Policy:** Essential for strategic autonomy in critical sectors (Semiconductors, Defense). Market failures prevent early-stage industrialization without state support.
* **Argument Against (The Critique):** * "Government Failure" is often worse than "Market Failure." Bureaucrats picking winners (e.g., specific PLI sectors) often leads to cronyism.
    * **Raghuram Rajan's Critique:** We might be subsidizing low-value assembly jobs while neglecting the high-value component ecosystem.
* **The Middle Path:**
    * Focus on **Factor Market Reforms** (Land, Labor, Logistics) rather than just tariff walls.
    * Use "Sunset Clauses" for tariffs (protection should be temporary, not permanent).

### 🗝️ Key Terms for Prelims
* **Inverted Duty Structure:** When tax on inputs > tax on finished goods.
* **Friend-shoring:** Moving supply chains to politically allied countries.
* **Fiscal Cost of Protectionism:** Revenue forgone due to tax breaks vs. revenue gained from tariffs.

### 🧠 Connection to Syllabus
* **GS3:** *Effects of liberalization on the economy, changes in industrial policy and their effects on industrial growth.*
* **GS2:** *Government policies and interventions for development in various sectors.*
