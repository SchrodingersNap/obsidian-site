# 📉 Debt Dynamics: The Consolidation Path

## 1. General Government Debt
* **Performance:** India reduced Debt-to-GDP by **7.1% points** since 2020.
* **Comparison:** While Advanced Economies (US, UK, France) saw debt rise, India consolidated.
* **Investment Efficiency:** India's Govt Investment (4% of GDP) is higher than peers relative to revenue.

## 2. The New Fiscal Anchor (Box II.8)
* **Old Anchor:** 3% Fiscal Deficit (FRBM).
* **New Anchor:** **Debt-to-GDP ratio of 50 ± 1% by FY31**.
* **Why?** Deficit targets (flow) are volatile; Debt targets (stock) capture cumulative performance.

## 3. Debt Sustainability Analysis (Box II.9)
Using **Bohn’s Fiscal Response Function (FRF)**:
* **Finding:** India's fiscal policy is sustainable.
* **Logic:** When debt rises ($d_{t-1}$), the primary balance ($pb_t$) improves.
* **Coefficient:** Positive reaction to debt accumulation ensures no explosive debt spiral.

## 4. Debt Profile
* **Rollover Risk:** Low. Weighted Average Maturity = **19 years** (Fresh issuance).
* **External Risk:** Low. External debt is only **2.6% of GDP**.
* **Currency Risk:** Most debt is domestic (Rupee-denominated).
