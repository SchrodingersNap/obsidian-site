# 📈 Capital Markets & Household Savings

## 1. The "Financialisation" of Savings (Box III.7)
A structural shift is visible in Indian household balance sheets.
* **Trend:** Shift from *Deposits* $\rightarrow$ *Equities/Mutual Funds*.
* **Data:**
    * Share of Equities in annual financial savings: **~2% (FY12)** $\rightarrow$ **15.2% (FY25)**.
    * Share of Deposits: Dropped from 58% to **35%**.
    * **SIP Revolution:** Monthly SIP flows increased **7x** since FY17.
* **Ownership:** DII (Domestic Institutional Investor) holding (**18.3%**) has surpassed FII holding (**16.7%**) for the first time.
    * *Significance:* Domestic savings are now the primary shock absorber against global volatility.

## 2. Debt Market: The "Missing Middle"
While equities are booming, the **Corporate Bond Market** remains under-penetrated.
* **Size:** **16-17% of GDP** (vs 40% in USA, 38% in China).
* **Issues:**
    * Skewed towards **AAA/AA** rated issuers (85-90% of issuances).
    * Dominance of **Private Placements** (99%) over Public Offers.
    * Low secondary market liquidity.

## 3. GIFT City (IFSC)
* **Status:** Ranked **43rd** globally (GFCI).
* **New Innovation:** **Foreign Currency Settlement System (FCSS)** launched in Oct 2025 to enable local settlement of dollar transactions, reducing reliance on correspondent banks.
