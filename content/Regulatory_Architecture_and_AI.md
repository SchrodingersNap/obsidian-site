# ⚖️ Refining the Regulatory Architecture

## 1. Securities Markets Code, 2025 (Box III.6)
A landmark bill to consolidate fragmented laws (SEBI Act, SCRA, Depositories Act).
* **Key Features:**
    * **Board Composition:** Increases SEBI board to **15 members** (min 6 independent).
    * **Independence:** Codifies cooling-off periods and removal protections.
    * **MIIs:** Stock Exchanges/Depositories recognized as "Statutory Organs of Governance" (not just utilities).
    * **Adjudication:** Caps interim orders to **180 days** (prevents indefinite freeze).

## 2. RBI's FREE-AI Framework (Box III.2)
To regulate AI in finance without stifling innovation.
* **Principles (7 Sutras):** Trust, People First, Innovation over restraint, Fairness, Accountability, Understandability, Safety.
* **Reality Check:** Adoption is currently limited to chatbots/efficiency; autonomous decision-making is low.

## 3. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC)
* **Success:**
    * Recovery Rate improved to **~30%** (vs 15-20% pre-IBC).
    * Credit discipline improved (Overdue loans dropped from 18% to 9%).
* **Challenge (The "Binding Constraint"):**
    * **Delays:** Average resolution takes **713 days** (Statutory limit: 330 days).
    * **Pendency:** NCLT has 30,600 pending cases.
    * **Shortage:** Only 2,198 active Resolution Professionals (RPs).

> [!WARNING] Regulatory Philosophy
> The Survey advocates shifting from **"Entity-based"** to **"Activity-based"** regulation. If a Fintech does banking, it should be regulated like a bank, regardless of its label.
