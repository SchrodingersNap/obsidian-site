# 🚀 Outlook: A Higher Growth Frontier

## Box I.4: Reassessing Potential Growth
The Survey claims India's potential growth has shifted from 6.5% to **7%**.

### The Growth Accounting Framework
$$Y = A K^\alpha L^{1-\alpha}$$
* $Y$: Output
* $K$: Capital Stock
* $L$: Labour Input
* $A$: Total Factor Productivity (TFP)

### Why the increase?
1.  **Capital ($K$):**
    * Investment boom (Public Capex + Private revival).
    * Capital stock growth expected to return to **7.6%**.
2.  **Labour ($L$):**
    * Rising [[Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR)]] (especially women).
    * Labour Codes + Skilling.
3.  **TFP ($A$):**
    * Digital Infrastructure (UPI, GSTN) reduces transaction costs.
    * Logistics reforms (ULIP).
    * **Allocative Efficiency:** Capital moving to productive sectors.

### Projections
* **FY27 GDP Forecast:** **6.8% - 7.2%**.
* **Risks:** Geopolitical conflicts, AI bubble burst (Global), Trade wars.
* **Condition:** Reforms must be *persistent*, not episodic.

> [!NOTE] Final Conclusion
> India is positioned for steady expansion. The risks are primarily external (Geopolitics), while the strengths are domestic (Consumption + Capex).
