# ⚙️ Process Reforms: Efficiency in Spending

## 1. Just-in-Time (JIT) Fund Release (Box II.4)
* **Old Model:** "Credit Push" (Bulk release to agencies $\rightarrow$ Idle funds float).
* **New Model:** "Debit Pull" (Release funds only when expenditure occurs).
* **Tools:** **SNA-SPARSH** (For Centrally Sponsored Schemes) and **TSA** (Treasury Single Account).
* **Impact:** Idle float reduced from ₹1.67 Lakh Cr to **₹0.4 Lakh Cr**. Huge interest savings.

## 2. Route Optimization in PDS (RO-PDS)
* **Tech:** Algorithms by IIT-Delhi & World Food Programme.
* **Goal:** Optimize grain movement from Warehouse to Fair Price Shop.
* **Result:** Transport distance ⬇️ 50%; CO2 emissions ⬇️ 35%. Savings of ₹250 Cr.

## 3. NUDGE Theory in Taxation (Box II.1)
* **Concept:** Non-intrusive Usage of Data to Guide and Enable.
* **Action:** Sending gentle prompts about mismatch in High-Value Transactions vs. Returned Income.
* **Success:** 91,000 taxpayers corrected 80GGC claims; ₹2,050 Cr wrongful deductions prevented.

## 4. Strategic Disinvestment
* **Proposal:** Redefine "Government Company" to require only **26% stake** (effective control) instead of 51%.
* **Benefit:** Allows deeper disinvestment while retaining control over strategic CPSEs.
