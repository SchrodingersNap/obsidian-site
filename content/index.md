# Welcome to the Field Station 📡

I am a **Field Officer** & **Shift Incharge**, currently navigating the chaos of daily operations while decoding the **UPSC** syllabus and building **Quant** strategies. 

This is my "Second Brain"—a digital garden where I connect the dots between Engineering, Philosophy, and Administration.
