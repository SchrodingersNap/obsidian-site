# 🌐 From Hyper-Globalization to Geostrategic Fragmentation

The global trade landscape has shifted from **Efficiency** $\rightarrow$ **Security**.

## 1. The Three Challenges
The Survey identifies three concurrent global headwinds:
1.  **Trade Policy Uncertainty (TPU):** Retaliatory tariffs and protectionism.
2.  **Strategic Decoupling:** Tech sovereignty (Semiconductors) and Critical Minerals races.
3.  **Weaponization of Trade:** Using economic tools for national security.

## 2. New Terminologies (UPSC Keywords)
* **Friend-shoring:** Trading primarily with political allies (Resurgence seen in 2025).
* **Near-shoring:** Sourcing from geographically close countries (Slight improvement in Q3 2025).
* **Geostrategic Globalization:** Countries remain interconnected but exercise extreme caution regarding *whom* they rely on.

[!NOTE] Data Point The **Trade Policy Uncertainty (TPU) Index** peaked in April 2025, reaching levels not seen since 1960.
