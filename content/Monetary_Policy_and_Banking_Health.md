# 📉 Monetary Policy & Banking Sector

## 1. Monetary Policy Stance (FY26)
* **Action:** Cumulative **100 bps cut** in Repo Rate (Current: **5.25%**).
* **Stance:** Shifted from *Accommodative* to **Neutral** (June 2025).
* **Liquidity Management:**
    * **CRR Cut:** Reduced by 100 bps to **3.0%**.
    * **Impact:** Released ₹2.5 Lakh Crore primary liquidity.
    * **Money Multiplier:** Rose to **6.21** (indicating better credit creation).

> [!NOTE] UPSC Concept: Money Multiplier
> A rise in the Money Multiplier ($M_3/M_0$) usually indicates efficient financial intermediation. The CRR cut reduces the denominator ($M_0$), mathematically increasing the multiplier, but also practically allows banks to lend more.

## 2. Banking Sector Health (The "Twin Balance Sheet" Resolution)
The banking sector is in its best shape in decades.
* **Asset Quality:**
    * **GNPA (Gross Non-Performing Assets):** Multi-decadal lows (Industry: 1.9%, Services: 1.8%).
    * **Exception:** Agriculture GNPA remains high at **6.0%**.
    * **Slippage Ratio:** Dropped to **1.3%**.
* **Capital Adequacy (CRAR):** Robust at **17.2%**.
* **Credit Growth:**
    * **Personal Loans:** Highest growth (12.8%), driven by **Gold Loans** (+125% YoY due to price rise).
    * **MSME Credit:** Strong growth (**21.8%**), aided by digital footprints/CAM.
    * **Large Industry:** Muted bank credit growth because corporates are shifting to **Non-Bank Sources** (Bonds/ECBs) due to high internal accruals (profitability).

## 3. RRBs (Regional Rural Banks)
* **Consolidation:** Reduced from 196 to **28** (One-State-One-RRB principle).
* **Performance:** Consistently meeting Priority Sector Lending (PSL) targets (>75%).
