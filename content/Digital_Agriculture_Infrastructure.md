# Digital Agriculture & Infrastructure

The modernization of Indian agriculture is being driven by the "Digital Public Infrastructure" (DPI) approach, moving beyond physical roads to digital highways.

## 🖥️ The Digital Stack
**1. AgriStack & Digital Agriculture Mission (DAM):**
* **Goal:** Create a unique Farmer ID (FID).
* **Components:** Unified farmer registry, linkage with land records, and soil health data.
* **Utility:** Seamless delivery of credit and insurance (PMFBY).

**2. e-NAM (National Agriculture Market):**
* **Status:** Integrated 1,522 Mandis.
* **Volume:** 1.79 Crore farmers registered.
* **Function:** Price discovery mechanism to break local monopolies.

**3. Decision Support Systems:**
* **Krishi-DSS:** Geospatial data integration for crop mapping and drought monitoring.

## 🏗️ Physical Infrastructure
**Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF):**
* **Corpus:** ₹1 Lakh Crore.
* **Focus:** Post-harvest management (Cold storage, Warehousing).
* **Progress:** ₹1.23 Lakh Crore mobilized (Nov 2025).

## 🤝 The Cooperative Reboot
**PACS (Primary Agricultural Credit Societies)** are being transformed:
* **Computerization:** 67,930 PACS being digitized (ERP based).
* **Multi-purpose:** PACS are now allowed to operate generic medicine shops, fuel stations, and storage units.
* **Decentralized Storage:** World's largest grain storage plan via PACS to reduce food wastage at the village level.
