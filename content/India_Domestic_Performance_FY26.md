# 🏭 Domestic Performance: The Twin Engines

India's growth (7.4%) is internally driven.

## 1. Demand Side (Expenditure)
* **[[Private Final Consumption Expenditure]] (PFCE):**
    * Share in GDP: **61.5%** (Highest since FY12).
    * Growth: 7.5%.
    * *Driver:* Rural demand recovery (NABARD survey shows 79% households reported increased consumption).
* **[[Gross Fixed Capital Formation]] (GFCF - Investment):**
    * Share in GDP: **30%**.
    * Growth: 7.6%.
    * *Driver:* Sustained Public Capex + Revival in Private Corporate Investment.

## 2. Supply Side (GVA)

### 🌾 Agriculture (The Stabilizer)
* **Growth:** 3.1% (FY26) vs 4.6% (FY25).
* **Analysis:**
    * *Crops:* Volatile.
    * *Allied Sectors (Livestock/Fisheries):* Stable growth (5-6%).
    * *Outlook:* Rabi sowing up (Wheat +1.9%, Gram +5.1%).

### 🏗️ Industry (The Rebound)
* **Growth:** 6.2%.
* **Manufacturing:** **7.0%** (vs Pre-covid trend of 5.2%).
* **Debunking De-industrialization:** The survey argues Manufacturing share in *Real GVA* is stable (17-18%). The decline in *Nominal* share is due to "Relative Price Effects" (Services prices rose faster than Goods).

### 💻 Services (The Driver)

* **Standouts:** Financial Services, Real Estate, Professional Services.
* **Lagging:** Trade & Hotels (Still recovering).
