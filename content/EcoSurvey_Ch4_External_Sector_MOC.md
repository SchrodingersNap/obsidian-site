# 🌍 External Sector: Playing the Long Game

> [!ABSTRACT] Chapter Thesis
> The era of "Hyper-globalization" is over. We have entered the age of **"Geostrategic Globalization"**, where trade is dictated by national security and supply chain resilience rather than just cost efficiency.
>
> Despite this fragmentation, India demonstrates resilience:
> * **Exports:** Record $825.3B (FY25).
> * **Services:** The surplus ($188B) is financing ~66% of the merchandise trade deficit.
> * **Capital:** Strong Remittances ($135B) and resilient FDI despite a global slowdown.
> * **Outlook:** The long game requires shifting from "market access" to **"structural competitiveness"** in manufacturing.
