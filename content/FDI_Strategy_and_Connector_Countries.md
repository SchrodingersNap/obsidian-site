# 🏭 FDI Strategy & The "Connector" Model

## 1. Global FDI Context
* Global FDI is shrinking (-11% in 2024).
* Capital is moving away from *Infrastructure* to *Technology/AI*.

## 2. India's Position
* **Inflows:** $81.0 Bn Gross FDI (FY25).
* **Greenfield Projects:** Ranked **4th globally**.
* **Net FDI:** Low ($5.6 Bn in Apr-Nov FY26) due to rising **Repatriation** and **Outward FDI (ODI)**.
    * *Note:* Rising ODI is good—it shows Indian firms are acquiring strategic assets abroad (Box IV.4).

## 3. The "Connector Country" Strategy (Box IV.3)
Countries like **Vietnam, Mexico, and Poland** are thriving as "Connectors" between geopolitical blocs (US vs China).
* **India's Challenge:** To become a connector, we need:
    1.  **Direct GVC Engagement:** A dedicated task force to talk to top 50 Global Value Chain anchors.
    2.  **State-Level Reforms:** FDI happens in states, not in New Delhi.
    3.  **Logistics:** Improve ranking (Currently 38th in Logistics Performance Index).

## 4. Case Study: The TRIPS Shock (Box IV.1)
* **Context:** In 1995, India had to accept Product Patents (TRIPS), ending the era of reverse-engineering.
* **Reaction:** Pharma sector didn't die; it upgraded R&D, filed DMFs (Drug Master Files), and became a global generic powerhouse.
* **Lesson:** Indian industry can survive "Tariff Shocks" (like US tariffs) by upgrading capabilities, not by seeking protection.
