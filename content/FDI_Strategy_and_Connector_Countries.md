# 🏭 FDI Strategy & The "Connector" Model

> [!ABSTRACT] Executive Summary
> Global FDI is shrinking (-11%), shifting away from infrastructure to **AI & Tech**. In this fragmented world, countries like Vietnam and Mexico are thriving as **"Connector Countries"**—linking rival geopolitical blocs (US & China). 
>
> The Survey argues India must pivot from just "seeking investment" to **"Strategic Indispensability"** in Global Value Chains (GVCs).

## 1. Global Context: The Investment Chill
* **Global FDI:** Declined by **11%** in 2024.
* **The Shift:** Capital is moving out of long-gestation projects (Infrastructure) into short-cycle, high-tech sectors (Semiconductors, Data Centers).
* **India's Resilience:** Despite the global slump, India ranked **4th globally** in Greenfield Project announcements.

## 2. The "Connector Country" Strategy (Box IV.3)
How are Vietnam, Mexico, and Poland winning the FDI game?
They position themselves as "Connectors"—neutral grounds where goods are assembled to bypass tariffs between rival blocs.

### What India Needs to Do:
1.  **Target GVC Anchors:** Create a dedicated task force to directly engage the top 50 Global Value Chain leaders (e.g., Apple, Foxconn).
2.  **State-Level Reforms:** FDI lands in States, not in New Delhi. Competitive federalism is key.
3.  **Logistics:** Improve the **Logistics Performance Index (LPI)** rank (Currently 38th) to match Vietnam.

## 3. Case Study: The TRIPS Shock (Box IV.1)
*A lesson in turning crisis into opportunity.*

**The Crisis (1995):** India forced to sign **TRIPS** (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights).
* *Before TRIPS:* India used "Process Patents" (Reverse engineering drugs).
* *After TRIPS:* "Product Patents" mandatory. Fear that Indian Pharma would die.

**The Response:**
Instead of dying, Indian Pharma:
1.  **Upgraded R&D:** Moved from copying to creating complex generics.
2.  **Filed DMFs:** Massive filing of *Drug Master Files* in the USA.
3.  **Result:** Became the "Pharmacy of the World."

> [!TIP] The Lesson for Today
> Just as Pharma survived the TRIPS shock, Indian manufacturing can survive current **Tariff Shocks** (e.g., US Tariffs) by upgrading capabilities rather than seeking protectionism.

## 4. Outward FDI (ODI): A Sign of Maturity (Box IV.4)
Is money leaving India (ODI) bad? **No.**
* **Trend:** Indian firms investing abroad rose to **$23.6 Bn** (FY25).
* **Top Destinations:** Singapore (27%), USA (16%), UAE (10%).
* **Significance:** It shows Indian firms are acquiring **Strategic Assets** (Tech, Brands, Energy) abroad to strengthen domestic competitiveness.
