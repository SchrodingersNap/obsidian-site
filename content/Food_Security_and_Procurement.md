# Food Management: Procurement to Plate

India's food management strategy is pivoting from "availability" to "accessibility and absorption."

## 🛡️ The Safety Net
* **NFSA (2013):** Covers 81.35 Crore people (75% Rural / 50% Urban).
* **PMGKAY:** Extension of free foodgrains (absorbing the economic shock for the bottom of the pyramid).

## ⚙️ Operational Reforms
**1. One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC):**
* Allows migrants to access rations anywhere in India.
* **Technology:** Aadhaar-based Biometric Authentication.
* **Success:** 99.8% Ration cards seeded with Aadhaar.

**2. Reducing Leakages:**
* Use of **GPS tracking** for foodgrain trucks (Vehicle Location Tracking System).
* Data deduplication to remove bogus cards (2.12 Crore ineligible beneficiaries removed).

## 🔄 The Diversification Strategy
*An innovative proposal in the Survey:*
Using procurement savings to fund diversification.
* **Current State:** FCI holds excess buffer stocks of Rice/Wheat -> High carrying cost.
* **Proposal:** Use the money saved from *not* storing excess grain to incentivise farmers in Punjab/Haryana to switch to **Pulses and Oilseeds**.
* **Benefit:** Reduces import bill, improves soil health (legumes fix nitrogen), and solves the storage glut.
