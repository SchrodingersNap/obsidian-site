# 🤝 Financial Inclusion & Microfinance

## 1. The Microfinance Critique (Box III.3)
The Survey offers a scathing critique of the "Financialization" of microfinance by PE/VC funds.
* **The Issue:** **"Impact Washing"**—using metrics like *number of borrowers* (Scale) instead of *household welfare* (Impact).
* **Consequence:** Aggressive lending $\rightarrow$ Over-indebtedness $\rightarrow$ Stress in MFI sector (Loan outstanding fell 14% in FY25).
* **Policy Shift:** RBI reduced "Qualifying Assets" limit from 75% to 60% to allow diversification.
* **Recommendation:** Investor exits should be linked to **verified social outcomes**, not just financial valuation.

## 2. Government Schemes: The "Graduation" Model (Box III.4)
* **PM SVANidhi:**
    * **Success:** 20% annual income growth for beneficiaries.
    * **Graduation:** Borrowers moving from 1st cycle (₹10k) to 3rd cycle (₹50k).
    * **Asset Creation:** Borrowers investing in fixed assets saw **33%** income growth.
* **PMMY (Mudra):** 69% of loans to **Women** entrepreneurs.

## 3. Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)
* **UPI:** Not just for payments, but for **Credit**. Transaction history acts as collateral substitute (Information Collateral).
* **FI Index:** Rose to **67.0** (March 2025).

**Essay Perspective:**
* "Finance is not merely funding, but the architecture of economic transformation."
* Inclusion is fragile if it relies only on debt. It must lead to **Asset Accumulation**.
