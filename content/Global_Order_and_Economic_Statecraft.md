# 🌍 The New Global Order: Fragile & Diverging

The global economy is no longer driven by "Efficiency" but by **Security**. The Survey highlights the shift from *Economic Policy* to *Economic Statecraft*.

## 1. Economic Statecraft: The New Weapon
* **Definition:** Using economic means (Trade, Finance, Tech) to achieve *strategic* or *military* ends.
* **Historical Context:** From the *Megarian Decree* (Athens) to modern Semiconductor bans.

| Feature | **Economic Policy** | **Economic Statecraft** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Goal** | Growth, Inflation Control | National Security, Coercion |
| **Tools** | Interest Rates, Taxes | Sanctions, Export Controls, Blacklists |
| **Logic** | Efficiency | Strategic Leverage |

### 🛠️ Tools of Modern Statecraft (Box I.1)
1.  **Export Controls:** US restrictions on Chips/AI to China.
2.  **Critical Mineral Bans:** China's curbs on Rare Earths/Gallium.
3.  **Tariffs:** [[EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)]] and US Tariffs.
4.  **Friend-Shoring:** Moving supply chains to allies.

## 2. India's Response: "Strategic Indispensability"
India cannot just rely on resilience. It must become **Indispensable**.
* **Strategy:** Be so critical to Global Value Chains (GVCs) that coercion becomes too costly for the aggressor.
* **Action Plan:** Dominate [[Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)]], Pharmacy, and High-end Manufacturing.



## 3. Global Economic Trends
* **US:** Strong growth driven by **AI Investment** (IT spending = 50% of GDP growth).
* **China:** Deflationary pressures + Property crisis.
* **Europe:** Stagnant (Germany struggling), Spain outperforming.
* **FDI Flows:** Global FDI ⬇️ 11%, but AI-related FDI to US ⬆️ 19.7%.
