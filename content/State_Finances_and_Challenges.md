# 🏛️ State Finances: A Mixed Bag

## 1. The Fiscal Picture
* **Deficits:** Combined Fiscal Deficit rose to **3.2%** (FY25 PA).
* **Revenue Deficit:** 10 States slipped into revenue deficit.
* **Revenue Sources:** Own Tax Revenue share increased to **50%**.

## 2. The SASCI Lifeline
* **Scheme:** *Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment*.
* **Mechanism:** 50-year interest-free loans from Centre.
* **Impact:** Kept State Capex stable at **2.4% of GDP**. Without SASCI, it would have collapsed to 1.92%.
* **Allocation (FY26):** ₹1.5 Lakh Crore (₹80k Cr tied to reforms).

## 3. The "Unconditional Cash Transfer" (UCT) Trap (Box II.7)
The Survey sounds a strong alarm on **Freebies**.
* **Scale:** ₹1.7 Lakh Crore estimated for FY26 (Women-centric UCTs).
* **Trade-off:** "Crowding out resources for capital investments."
* **Evidence:** NBER study shows UCTs improve consumption but *do not* improve child nutrition or education outcomes unless conditional.
* **Recommendation:** Move to **Conditional Cash Transfers** (like Mexico's *Progresa* or Brazil's *Bolsa Familia*) linked to school attendance/health checkups.
