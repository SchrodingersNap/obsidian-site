# 🚢 Merchandise Trade: Diversification & Complexity

## 1. Performance Overview (FY25)
India's merchandise trade reflects a resilient core despite volatility in global commodity prices.

* **Total Exports:** $437.7 Bn. (Growth remained flat primarily due to a dip in oil and gems/jewellery).
* **The "Core" Strength:** **Non-Petroleum, Non-Gems exports grew by 7.5%**, reaching a historic high. This indicates structural growth in manufacturing.
* **Top Drivers:** * **Telecom Instruments:** +51.2% (The superstar of FY25).
	* **Drugs & Pharmaceuticals:** +11.2% (Reinforcing India as the 'Pharmacy of the World').

## 2. The PLI Effect (Production Linked Incentive)
The PLI scheme has successfully initiated a shift towards high-value manufacturing. However, it has also created a "Trade Dichotomy":

### A. High Export Momentum
| Sector | Average Annual Growth (FY21-25) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **IT Hardware** | **+77.2%** |
| **ACC Batteries** | **+45.0%** |
| **Electronics** | **+38.8%** |

### B. The Import Correlation

As exports of finished goods rise, imports of intermediate components also rise. This is a natural phase of **Global Value Chain (GVC)** integration. 

> [!TIP] Success Spotlight: Telecom
> The **Telecom sector** has achieved early-stage import substitution:
> * **Exports:** ⬆️ 1.5% AAGR
> * **Imports:** ⬇️ 18.5% AAGR

## 3. The "Economic Complexity" Challenge
India is currently at a critical junction in its industrial evolution.

* **Current Rank:** **44th** on the [[Economic Complexity Index (ECI)]].
* **The Problem:** Our export basket is still weighted toward low-complexity goods like refined petroleum and rice.
* **The Potential:** India ranks **2nd globally** on the **Complexity Outlook Index (COI)**.
	* *Meaning:* India already possesses the "hidden" capabilities to diversify into highly sophisticated products (precision engineering, advanced chemicals) if policy hurdles are removed.
## 4. Agricultural Exports: The $100 Billion Dream

India is the world's 2nd largest producer but only the **2.2%** global exporter of agri-products.
- **Current Status:** Stagnated at **$51.1 Bn**.
- **Critical Policy Critique:** The Survey warns against using **ad-hoc export bans** or Minimum Export Prices (MEP) to manage domestic inflation.
    > "Export markets once lost are not easily recovered. Frequent policy changes cause foreign buyers to switch to other sources."
### The "Twin-Track" Recommendation:
1. **Price Stability:** Use **Buffer Stocks**, PDS, and Open Market Sales to control domestic prices.
2. **Export Continuity:** Allow farmers to tap global markets consistently to increase rural incomes and gain international leverage.

## 5. Strategic Convergence: Transfer Pricing & Customs

To reduce the **Compliance Burden** on GVC-integrated firms, the Survey proposes:
- **Convergence:** Aligning methodologies between _Income Tax (Transfer Pricing)_ and _Customs Valuation_.
- **Goal:** A single-window administrative review to prevent identical transactions from being audited twice, improving the **Ease of Doing Business**.
